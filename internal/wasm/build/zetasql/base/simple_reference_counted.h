  // A move constructor or any function accepting an rvalue reference to a
  // reference counted object does not add much value. Reference counted objects
  // are always reference objects; it is illegal for any function to return a
  // reference counted object by value. So there is not really such a thing as
  // an rvalue reference counted object.
  // Lacking any obvious benefits, and given the subtleties of move constructors
  // and defining a reference counted object's invariants with move semantics,
  // we disable the default move constructor.
  // A copy constructor has similar (although less subtle) considerations, and
  // as we do not provide a move constructor, we do not provide a copy
  // constructor either.
  // Derived classes can still create their own copy constructors if they desire
  // one. Such a custom constructor should simply invoke the default constructor
  // of SimpleReferenceCounted which will initialize the ref count of the new
  // instance to 1. Creating a move constructor is strongly discouraged.

  // refcount::reffed_ptr, or use other means to ensure that code can not refer
  // to an instance without also holding a reference on that instance.

  // One example how RefCountIsOne() can be used is to implement copy-on-write

  // private destructor, so this has to be protected.

  // The OnRefCountIsZero() function is invoked by Unref() once the reference
  // count reaches 0, i.e., when the final reference on this instance has been
  // removed and the object can be deleted.
  //
  // The default implementation will simply delete the instance, i.e., call
  // 'delete this'. Derived classes can override this function if they require
  // custom finalization / deallocation functions, or if they otherwise want to
  // control the life cycle of their instances.
  //
  // There is no requirement that the OnRefCountIsZero() method directly
  // destroys the object. For example, a derived class which has a substantial
  // construction and allocation cost may choose to override the
  // OnRefCountIsZero() method and freelist instances for re-use rather then
  // delete them directly.
  //
  // Classes that implement the OnRefCountIsZero() function to freelist objects
  // must make sure to call Ref() on the object before re-using it.
  // The preferred pattern is to call Ref() (and perform other essential class
  // re-initialization) directly inside the OnRefCountIsZero() function before
  // freelisting or otherwise re-using the object.
  //
  // While we explictly allow/require the reference count to be incremented
  // again from the OnRefCountIsZero handler extending the instance's life
  // cycle, calling Unref() directly or indirectly from OnRefCountIsZero()
  // should be avoided as it may trigger the reference count to drop to zero,
  // and cause a recursive loop.
  // Applications with custom OnRefCountIsZero handlers must make sure that the
  // reference count does not reach zero again inside the handler function.

  //
  //   class MyHeavyBlob : public SimpleReferenceCounted {
  //    public:
  //     static MyHeavyBlob* New() {
  //        MyHeavyBlob* blob = m_freelist.Pop();

  //        Ref();
  //        items_.clear();
